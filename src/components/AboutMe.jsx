                            My journey into tech began in an unexpected place â€“ while working as a translator and news editor, I found myself fascinated by the HTML code in our content management system.
                            That spark of curiosity led me to pursue a <b>Master's in Information Technology</b>  and completely reinvent my career path.

                            Today, I blend my communication background with technical skills to create user experiences that truly connect.
                            I love diving into <b>UX/UI design</b> with Figma; building <b>responsive interfaces</b> with React, Svelte, and JavaScript; crafting <b>backend solutions</b> with Node.js and REST APIs; as well as working with <b>databases</b> like SQL and MongoDB. My editorial eye helps me spot the details that make digital experiences feel polished and intuitive.

                            I'm the teammate who quietly ensures everything works smoothly, who finds joy in solving complex problems, and who believes <b>a supportive environment brings out everyone's best work</b>.

                            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring more about <b>digital marketing</b> and <b>technical writing</b>, solving puzzles, building Lego creations, occasionally drawing something, capturing city moments through my camera lens, or exploring Auckland's spicy food after a refreshing hike.
